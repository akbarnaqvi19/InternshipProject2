Project 2:

The project aims to classify different species of Iris flowers based on their characteristics
The IRIS dataset is loaded to the project
Data visualization is done through plots 

A Decision Tree Classifier is employed 
The Classifier model is trained on the IRIS dataset

The Trained model is then saved as a (.pkl) file

The Trained model is then called when the Testing code is run
Input Features are taken from the user and feed to the Classifier

Iris Species is Classified based on the input features and displayed
